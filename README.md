# AWS VPC Peering Secure Connectivity Architecture

## Overview
Implemented VPC peering to enable secure communication between environments while maintaining network segmentation and controlled access, reducing reliance on public internet routing.

## Architecture Components
- Multiple Amazon VPCs representing separate environments  
- VPC peering connections for private communication  
- Route table updates to enable controlled connectivity  
- Security groups to regulate inter-VPC traffic  

## Security & Network Segmentation Principles
- Secure inter-VPC communication over private networking  
- Maintained segmentation boundaries between environments  
- Controlled access using security groups and routing policies  
- Reduced exposure to public internet threats  

## Key Outcomes
- Enabled secure communication between business units  
- Preserved network isolation while allowing necessary access  
- Reduced attack surface by avoiding public internet routing  
- Improved network architecture for enterprise environments  

## Technologies Used
- Amazon VPC  
- VPC Peering  
- Route Tables  
- Security Groups  

## Status
Initial documentation. Enhancements and architecture diagrams coming.
